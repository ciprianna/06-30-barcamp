    <p>
      You just have to be passionate. At BarCamp, you won't find a predetermined speaker list or a line of suits passing out business cards. What you will find is some shaggy dude in a t-shirt talking about moonshine, a web developer talking about the best practices in SEO, or a world traveler sharing their experiences. BarCamp is a chance to network, learn something new, and communicate what you're most passionate about. Come one, come all.
